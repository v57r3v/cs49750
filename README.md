Writing Assignment #1: State of Nature  State   Justification
Instructions: You   should write a   (roughly)   six paragraph   short paper in which you explain and defend your view about the State of   Nature and   Justifying   the   State.   This   essay   should   be written   in your own words   (book and   slide quotes   should be used   seldomly or   not   at   all). Although   each   set   of   paragraphs address a different question, the paper   should   contain   a   unified   train   of   thought. The break down for   each   section   follows:
1. In the first and   second paragraph,   explain and   describe   the   view   about   the   State   of   Nature   you   believe to be correct. You   should align yourself   with   either Thomas Hobbes,   John Locke,   Jean Jacques Rousseau. These two paragraphs   should address the four   following   questions:
(a) What is the concept of   the “State of   Nature” in philosophy?
(b) What would the State of   Nature be like according to   your   chosen   philosopher?
(c) Does morality and moral motivation exist in the   state   of   nature?
(d) Are we better off in the State   of   Nature,   or with government?
These four questions   should be addressed in two   prosed   paragraphs. You   should   also   use   illustrations/examples to describe what the State of   Nature would be like.
2. In the third paragraph, describe in your   own words what it   means   to   justify political   obligation.   This paragraph   should address the two following   questions:
(a) What is the concept of   political   obligation?
(b) What are the two essential   features   that make   up   the   state?
These two questions   should be addressed in a   single prosed   paragraph.
3. In the fourth paragraph, explain the   Tacit   Consent Theory   of   justification   for   political   obli代 写Writing Assignment #1: State of Nature & State JustificationSQL

(a) What does it mean to tacitly connect,   as   opposed   to   explicitly   consent?
(b) How have citizen’s tacitly consented to   state   authority   account   to Tacit   Consent Theory?
(c) Why does David Hume or Robert Nozick   (select   only one)   reject   Tacit   Consent?
If   you would like to review Hume or Nozick’s   objection,   see Wolff,   pp.   43-44,   55-60.
4. In the   sixth   (and possibly seventh) paragraph, describe   and   explain   (in   some   detail)   the   view   about State   Justification do you accept as most correct: (i) tacit   consent   (Hobbes,   Locke,      Rousseau), (ii) hypothetical consent, (iii) prudential reasons to obey the   state   (David   Hume), (iv) anarchism: political obligations are unjustifiable and   should be resisted,   dismantled,   and   replaced   with   a   system of voluntaristic consent   (Kropotkin  Chomsky), (v) utilitarianism   (Bentham    Mill).   Don’t   simply   describe the view, but explain why you believe it is   correct.
Specifications: Your paper   should be,   12-point font, and double-spaced, and   submitted   as   a word document or pdf. It should be a   minimum   of   1,000 words,   but   there is   no   upper   limit.   It   should include your name, date, and the word count   at   the   top. The   submission   link is   on   Blackboard   (under Content).

Grading: Your paper will be graded on whether   (i) you correctly address   all   components   of   the prompt,   (ii) you correctly explained important definitions,   (iii) writing organization,   structure,   and   clarity.
